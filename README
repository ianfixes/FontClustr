FontClustr was conceived in January 2010 by Ian Katz.

It uses computer vision algorithms to sort fonts by appearance.

Tested in Ubuntu Jaunty Jackalope, requires the following packages:
 python-pythonmagick
 python-pygame
 python-gd
 python-gd
 python-opencv
 fonttools
 sqlite3
 python-sqlite
 python-wxgtk2.8

Probably other stuff that I can't think of right now.
