FontClustr was conceived in January 2010 by Ian Katz.

It uses computer vision algorithms to sort fonts by appearance.

Tested in Ubuntu 10.10, requiring the following packages:
 python-pygame
 python-opencv
 python-numpy
 python-imaging
 fonttools

Probably other stuff that I can't think of right now.

Run FontClustr as "python fontclustr.py" or make fontclustr.py executable and run it directly.

There is experimental support for a GUI version of FontClustr that caches results. 
Right now, it sucks.  Eventually it will be interactive.  "python gfontclustr.py"
